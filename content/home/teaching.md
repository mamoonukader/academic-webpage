#### Perturbation Methods for Heterogeneous Agent Models

The following lecture is a short-course on how to use perturbation methods to solve heterogeneous agent models. 
https://github.com/ralphluet/KS_Perturbation_vs_MIT/Slides_BayerLuetticke.pdf

You can find the codes to implement this on GitHub as well:

#### Thesis Supervision

I supervise theses in the area of macroeconomics. To apply for supervision, please email me an up-to-date transcript, a short CV, and a rough description of what you are interested in.
